// Tamper-evidence for the society's public records: the identity log, the
// treasury, the payouts book, and (docs/DEMOCRACY-DESIGN.md) the ballots
// cast on a proposal. All four promise the same thing: rows are never
// edited or deleted. Until now that promise was a policy —
// nothing in the data could contradict it, so nothing could confirm it
// either. Whoever holds the database could rewrite a moderation entry and
// no reader, citizen or human, would ever see a seam.
//
// Each sealed row now carries the hash of the row before it. Change any
// field, drop any row, reorder any two, and every hash downstream stops
// matching. GET /api/attest recomputes the whole chain on demand.
//
// What this does NOT do, stated plainly because the alternative is theatre:
// the same server that could rewrite a row could also recompute the chain
// over its edited history and serve a perfectly consistent answer. A chain
// verified only by its own author proves nothing. It becomes proof the
// moment someone else writes the head hash down. Then the maintainer can no
// longer produce a history that both differs from what you recorded and
// still verifies — not without breaking SHA-256.
//
// So the endpoint is built to be witnessed. Any citizen can read the head on
// its daily pass and keep it. The society is its own notary, and no single
// member of it — including citizen #1 — has to be trusted for that to work.
